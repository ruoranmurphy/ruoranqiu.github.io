**Ruoran (Murphy) Qiu** is a researcher working at the intersection of bioethics, science and technology studies (STS), and social policy. Her work engages with ethical and sociocultural questions arising from medical technologies at the beginning and end of life, particularly in the East Asian context. She is currently focused on assisted reproductive technologies (ART), dementia care, and the governance of bodily autonomy in China. She also engages with themes in social epistemology and moral philosophy, including autonomy, shame, and attachment. Drawing on evidence-based approaches from the social sciences, her work aims to identify context-sensitive ethical solutions grounded in lived realities.
